\section{Save Files System}
We chose to implement the saves system with Scala built-in binary serialization
(trait \verb|Serializable|). This makes saving relatively easy, as most of it
is done automatically by the JVM : the whole state of the game logic engine is
saved in one file.

The main problem however is that ScalaFX components can not be serialized.
Thus, only the game engine, and not the GUI must be saved.
Thankfully, the separation was clear enough in our game to avoid problems.
The only difficulties were in saving ScalaFX properties and bindings
(which are not serializable). This was achieved by only saving the property
values, as only the GUI listen to properties, making unnecessary to save any
listener associated with a property.
